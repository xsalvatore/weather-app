#Weather Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

##Introduction
As a way to familiarize myself with the MERN stack, I decided to build a simple weather application. It allows the user to enter a city and a country to get the current weather, a twelve hour forecast and a five day forecast.

##Tech Used
- Built using React for the front end.
- Makes request to the openweathermap API using Axios

##Install Guide
- Download the repository to your computer
- Open the terminal and access the location where the repository has been downloaded
