**Weather Application**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

As a way to get more familiar with the MERN stack, I decided to build a simple weather application. It allows the user to enter a city and a country to get the current weather, a twelve hour forecast and a five day forecast.

**Tech used :**
- React for the front-end
- Axios to make request to the openweathermap API

**Installation guide :**
- Download or clone the repo to your computer
- Open the terminal and access the location where the repo has been downloaded/cloned
- Run npm install to download the different modules
- Run npm start

*I have included the API keys for testing purposes and might be removed at any time.*
